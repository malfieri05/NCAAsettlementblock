## COMPARABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

### 1. **Secondary Market Annuities (SMAs)**
**Similarities:**
- Purchase of future payment streams at a discount
- Predictable cash flow structure
- Fixed timeline for payouts
- Lower correlation with traditional markets

**Key Differences:**
- SMAs are typically smaller, individual contracts requiring significant operational overhead
- Our block provides instant diversification and scale
- SMAs often have longer payout periods (20-30 years); NCAA settlement has defined, shorter timeline
- Our block eliminates the need to source and verify individual annuities

### 2. **Litigation Finance Funds**
**Similarities:**
- Alternative asset class with non-correlated returns
- Exposure to legal outcomes without direct litigation involvement
- Potential for attractive risk-adjusted returns
- Institutional investor familiarity with asset class

**Key Differences:**
- Traditional litigation finance funds invest in *ongoing* cases with uncertain outcomes
- Our block represents *settled* claims with defined payouts (significantly lower risk)
- Litigation funds typically have 3-7 year lockups; our block has clear, shorter payout timeline
- Traditional funds require ongoing legal management; our block is pre-verified and passive

### 3. **Structured Settlements**
**Similarities:**
- Rights to future payment streams from legal settlements
- Predictable returns over defined periods
- Common in institutional portfolios
- Fixed-income-like characteristics

**Key Differences:**
- Structured settlements are typically purchased individually, requiring extensive due diligence per contract
- Our aggregated block provides economies of scale and operational efficiency
- Individual structured settlements lack diversification; our block is inherently diversified
- Our verification process eliminates the "cherry-picking" problem of sourcing quality individual settlements

### 4. **Fixed-Income Securities (Corporate Bonds, Treasuries)**
**Similarities:**
- Defined payout timeline
- Predictable cash flows
- Lower volatility than equities
- Suitable for institutional portfolios

**Key Differences:**
- Current fixed-income yields (2025): ~4-5% for investment-grade bonds, ~2-3% for Treasuries
- Our block offers significantly higher yield potential (see return analysis below)
- Fixed-income is highly correlated with interest rate movements; our block is uncorrelated
- Fixed-income has credit/default risk; our block has settlement approval risk (already approved)

### 5. **Securities Class Action Settlement Claims**
**Similarities:**
- Aggregated claims from legal settlements
- Institutional investor familiarity
- Professional claim management required
- Economies of scale benefits

**Key Differences:**
- Class action claims often have complex eligibility requirements and ongoing litigation risk
- Our block has pre-verified eligibility and approved settlement
- Class actions can take 5-10 years; NCAA settlement has defined, shorter timeline
- Our block eliminates the need for ongoing legal monitoring
